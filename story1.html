      <p>Amira stood in line at the Public Affairs Office, clutching Form 72C. Around her, people murmured softly, eyes fixed on the floor tiles. The walls were covered in posters: ‘Civic Unity Ensures Stability.’ She had filled out every section, double-checked each tick box, and memorised her identification number.</p>

She would be allowed to attend her cousin’s wedding, provided she filed a Travel Permission Request before midday next Monday. It was, she thought, a small price for freedom—until she remembered the neighbour who hadn’t received approval last spring and moved away without saying goodbye.</p>
